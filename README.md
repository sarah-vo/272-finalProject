## Pig Tracker 🐷

<b>Pig Tracker</b> helps a farmer out in an imaginary scenario that all of his pigs are lost in Metro Vancouver and needs help from the community to track and capture the pigs!

## What it does 🤔
- Allows users to enter their personal information and the location of the sighted pigs
- The location of the pigs will be displayed on a map for easier visualization
- The farmer can choose to delete the individual log (password protected)


## What I've learnt 🧠
- Fully integrated TailwindCSS and used Material UI for the first time!
- Used a Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for location visualization
- A lot of Angular stuff
  - Directive is a very interesting feature that Angular has
  - MVC, SOLID, and Dependency Injection

## What I wish to implement 📝
- Accessibility features
- Better UI and Visualization
- A lot more!!
